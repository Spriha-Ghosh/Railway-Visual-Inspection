## Problem Scenario

:rotating_light: BREAKING NEWS- https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/may/08/uk-high-speed-trains-cancelled-after-cracks-found-in-carriages :rotating_light:

>Rail services on Britain’s main intercity lines were halted and passengers told of potential prolonged disruption ahead, after cracks were found on high-speed trains.
>All intercity trains on Great Western Railway and London North Eastern Railway were suspended on Saturday morning, as their entire fleets of Hitachi trains were taken out of service for safety.

:newspaper: :newspaper: :newspaper:
Urgent inspections were being carried out across the operators’ fleets after hairline cracks were discovered in several trains, with GWR trains suspected to be most affected.
Ministers ordered a rapid review after the latest problem discovered in the Hitachi trains led to them being withdrawn from the network overnight on Friday, leaving thousands of passengers unable to travel on lines linking London to Scotland and to the south-west.

## Project Context
```diff
* The application described in this project consists of inspecting railroad tracks for defects on crossties and rail fasteners using single-view line-scan cameras.
* The crossties may of different materials (e.g. wood, concrete, plastic, or metal), and the fasteners could be of different types (e.g. elastic clips, bolts, or spikes). 
* We have posed this problem as an detection problems: object detection (good, broken, or missing fastener)

## Data Description

The dataset used to demonstrate this approach comprises 85 miles of track in which the bounding boxes of 203,287 ties have been provided. This data is very challenging to work with. The images were collected from a moving vehicle and although there was artificial illumination, there are significant variations in illumination due to sun position and shadows. To reduce friction between rails and wheels and prolong their usable lives, railroads may lubricate them using special equipment mounted along the tracks. At locations near these lubricators, tracks get dirty and the accumulation of greasy deposits significantly change the appearance of the images. There are also some spots in which the tracks are covered by mud being pumped through the ballast during heavy rainfall. Moreover, there are also places in which the ballast is unevently distributed and pieces of ballast rock cover the ties and fasteners being inspected. Also, leaves, weeds, branches, trash and other debris may occlude the track components being inspected.
