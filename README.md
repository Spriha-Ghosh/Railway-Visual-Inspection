Urgent inspections were being carried out across the operators’ fleets after hairline cracks were discovered in several trains, with GWR trains suspected to be most affected.
Ministers ordered a rapid review after the latest problem discovered in the Hitachi trains led to them being withdrawn from the network overnight on Friday, leaving thousands of passengers unable to travel on lines linking London to Scotland and to the south-west.
